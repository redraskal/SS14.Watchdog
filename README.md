# SS14.Watchdog 

SS14.Watchdog (codename Ian) is SS14's server-hosting wrapper thing, similar to [TGS](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server) for BYOND (but much simpler for the time being). It handles auto updates, monitoring, automatic restarts, and administration. We recommend you use this for proper deployments.

Documentation on how setup and use for SS14.Watchdog is [here](https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/getting-started/hosting#ss14watchdog).

## Builds
The latest linux-x64 `master` build of SS14.Watchdog is available at https://ss14-watchdog.s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com/builds/latest.zip.
